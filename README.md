In this project, we simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. 
An initial stock level for a product.
The number of month(s) to plan.
The planned sales quantity for each month.
Based on this data, we calculated the required production quantity as follows.
If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0.
If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference
